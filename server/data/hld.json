    "coreConcepts": "## What is Load Balancing?\n\nLoad balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. It's a critical component for building scalable, highly available applications.\n\n## Types of Load Balancers\n\n### 1. Layer 4 (Transport Layer)\n- **TCP/UDP Load Balancing**\n- Operates at the transport layer\n- Routes traffic based on IP addresses and ports\n- Faster but less intelligent\n- Examples: HAProxy, AWS Network Load Balancer\n\n### 2. Layer 7 (Application Layer)\n- **HTTP/HTTPS Load Balancing**\n- Operates at the application layer\n- Can make routing decisions based on content\n- More intelligent but slightly slower\n- Examples: NGINX, AWS Application Load Balancer\n\n## Load Balancing Algorithms\n\n### 1. Round Robin\n- Distributes requests evenly across servers\n- Simple and fair\n- Good for servers with similar capacity\n\n### 2. Weighted Round Robin\n- Similar to round robin but with weights\n- Servers with higher capacity get more requests\n- Better for heterogeneous server environments\n\n### 3. Least Connections\n- Routes to server with fewest active connections\n- Good for long-lived connections\n- Helps prevent server overload\n\n### 4. IP Hash\n- Uses client IP to determine server\n- Ensures same client always goes to same server\n- Good for session affinity\n\n## Health Checks\n\nLoad balancers continuously monitor server health:\n- **Active Health Checks:** Proactively ping servers\n- **Passive Health Checks:** Monitor response times and error rates\n- **Graceful Degradation:** Remove unhealthy servers from rotation\n\n## Session Affinity (Sticky Sessions)\n\n- Ensures user sessions stay on the same server\n- Can be implemented via cookies or IP hashing\n- Trade-off between scalability and session management",

    "tradeoffs": "## Advantages\n\n- **High Availability:** If one server fails, traffic routes to healthy servers\n- **Scalability:** Easy to add/remove servers based on demand\n- **Performance:** Distributes load evenly, preventing bottlenecks\n- **Flexibility:** Can implement different routing strategies\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n- **Single Point of Failure:** Load balancer itself can become a bottleneck\n- **Complexity:** Adds another layer to the system architecture\n- **Cost:** Additional infrastructure and maintenance\n- **Session Management:** Challenges with stateful applications\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n### When to Use Load Balancing\n- High traffic applications\n- Need for high availability\n- Multiple server instances\n- Geographic distribution\n\n### When NOT to Use\n- Simple, low-traffic applications\n- Single server deployments\n- Tight coupling between components\n- Cost-sensitive projects\n\n## Implementation Strategies\n\n### 1. DNS Load Balancing\n- Multiple IP addresses for same domain\n- Simple but limited control\n- No health checking\n\n### 2. Hardware Load Balancers\n- Dedicated appliances (F5, Citrix)\n- High performance and reliability\n- Expensive and less flexible\n\n### 3. Software Load Balancers\n- NGINX, HAProxy, Envoy\n- More flexible and cost-effective\n- Can run on commodity hardware\n\n### 4. Cloud Load Balancers\n- AWS ALB, Google Cloud Load Balancer\n- Managed service with auto-scaling\n- Pay-per-use pricing model"

    "coreConcepts": "## What is Caching?\n\nCaching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in fast storage (memory) to reduce latency and improve system performance. It's one of the most effective ways to optimize application performance.\n\n## Types of Caching\n\n### 1. Application-Level Caching\n- **In-Memory Caching:** Store data in application memory\n- **Local Caching:** Cache within the same process\n- **Distributed Caching:** Cache across multiple servers\n\n### 2. Database Caching\n- **Query Result Caching:** Cache database query results\n- **Connection Pooling:** Reuse database connections\n- **Read Replicas:** Distribute read operations\n\n### 3. CDN Caching\n- **Static Content:** Images, CSS, JavaScript files\n- **Edge Locations:** Cache content closer to users\n- **Geographic Distribution:** Reduce latency globally\n\n## Caching Strategies\n\n### 1. Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)\n```\n1. Check cache for data\n2. If cache miss, fetch from database\n3. Store data in cache\n4. Return data to application\n```\n\n### 2. Write-Through\n```\n1. Write data to cache\n2. Write data to database\n3. Return success to application\n```\n\n### 3. Write-Behind (Write-Back)\n```\n1. Write data to cache\n2. Return success to application\n3. Asynchronously write to database\n```\n\n### 4. Refresh-Ahead\n```\n1. Proactively refresh cache before expiration\n2. Reduce cache miss latency\n3. More complex implementation\n```\n\n## Cache Eviction Policies\n\n### 1. LRU (Least Recently Used)\n- Evict least recently accessed items\n- Good for temporal locality\n- Most commonly used\n\n### 2. LFU (Least Frequently Used)\n- Evict least frequently accessed items\n- Good for long-term patterns\n- More complex to implement\n\n### 3. TTL (Time To Live)\n- Evict items after fixed time period\n- Simple and predictable\n- Good for time-sensitive data\n\n### 4. FIFO (First In, First Out)\n- Evict oldest items first\n- Simple implementation\n- May not reflect access patterns\n\n## Cache Invalidation\n\n### 1. Time-Based Invalidation\n- Set expiration time for cached data\n- Simple but may serve stale data\n- Good for data that changes infrequently\n\n### 2. Event-Based Invalidation\n- Invalidate cache when data changes\n- More complex but ensures consistency\n- Requires event system\n\n### 3. Version-Based Invalidation\n- Use version numbers to detect changes\n- Efficient for large datasets\n- Requires version tracking\n\n## Cache Consistency\n\n### 1. Strong Consistency\n- Cache always has latest data\n- Higher latency and complexity\n- Required for critical data\n\n### 2. Eventual Consistency\n- Cache will eventually have latest data\n- Lower latency\n- Acceptable for most use cases\n\n### 3. Weak Consistency\n- Cache may have stale data\n- Fastest performance\n- Only for non-critical data",
